Problem 2
=========

inputs: 

init_balance = balance
annualInterestRate

alg:

balance = init_balance
monthly interest rate = a / 12.0
unpaid = balance - monthly payment
balance = unpaid + (unpaid * monthly interest rate)

payment = 0
payment_sum = 0

while (balance > 0)
    balance = init_balance
    payment += 10
    for month to 12
        unpaid = balance - payment
        balance = unpaid + (mnthly_intst_rate * unpaid)

print 'Lowest Payment: ' + str(payment)

output:

lowest monthly payment that will pay off debt in under 1 year
